# NLP Twilight Reviews
Natural Language Processing (NLP) Twilight Review Library


This Natural Language Processing (NLP) library is a reusable framework with a tailored set of tools for natural language processing tasks. Built on top of libraries such as NLTK and matplotlib, this library offers a wide range of functionalities for processing, analyzing, and modeling textual data. In this report, the library is used to compare and analyze text and sentiment of consumer reviews for the movie Twilight (2008).

The library can load and register up to 10 movie reviews as text files at a time. The data from each text file is then cleaned, and statistics including most common words, sentiment score, and word count are gathered. Users can visualize this information as the library supports three graphs: a Sankey diagram displaying the 20 most common words across all given reviews and the number of occurrences, a line plot overlaid on a bar graph showing correlations between word count and sentiment scores, and pie charts showing the positive, neutral and negative scores that make up each sentiment score.
